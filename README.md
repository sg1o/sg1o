# Welcome to my Github Profile! 🚀

I am a computer engineer with a passion for cybersecurity. My main focus is on offensive security and I have experience working as a researcher in this field. I am currently finishing my Master's Degree in Cybersecurity and Cyberintelligence at the UPV.

Here you will find some of my projects and research. I hope you find them interesting and informative. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or want to collaborate on a project.

## Projects 🛠

- **OMBAG**: During my degree, I did a thesis on the optimization of compiled code, which among other objectives could achieve higher execution speed while reducing consumption.


- **MQTT Sensor Emulator**: I developed a small application that emulates sensors in an MQTT environment. This can be useful for testing and debugging IoT systems.

- **Rustling-Journey**: Projects for fun using Rust
